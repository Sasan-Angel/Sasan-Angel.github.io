            <p class="bio" >I am a passionate learner, It is my favourite way of having fun. In my free times I am learning about AI, Dapps & my beloved field of making mobile games with unity.</p>

            <p class="bio" >When I'm not working I often love to play guitar, play video games, or travel.</p>

            <p class="bio" >I talked a little more technical at bottom of this page.</p>

            <h1>Tipsy</h1>

            <p>We invented Tipsy ™ to reduce the number of heavy coins carrying every day. Tipsy ™ is a platform that handles Micro-Payments by credit cards.
            <p> Next time you can tip a waiter with tipsy, directly from your credit card. Street sellers, musicians, performers, and anyone can use Tipsy as a new income channel and let their audience to pay with credit cards.</p>

            <p>In this app I used crisp to provide live support, Fabric Crashlytics to analyze our user's behaviour and our app bugs, PayCardsRecognizer to scan credit cards, Google & Facebook & Apple Sign In, etc.</p>

            <p>Check it out on app store</p>

            <h1>iMoozik</h1>

            <p>This is iMoozik. with this application you can search and download any song on the internet into your iOS Device. You can also make playlists for yourself.</p>

            <p>I made it for educational purposes only.</p>

            <h1>SMS Police</h1>

            <p>This is SMS Police. This app seperates the spam sms messages and put it in different folder on your iOS device official messages app.</p>

            <p>By default applications don’t have access to messages that’s why I used “ Message Filter Extension ” that Apple provided to developers to enable them make some rules that decide if a message is spam or not.</p>

            <p>I used machine learning in this app so the ml model will get better in deciding which message is spam.</p>

            <p><br /></p>

            <h1 id="chaldeantraits">Rahyab</h1>



            <p>I developed this app for a startup in iOT field. with this app you can control you car with your mobile.</p>

            <p>You can control almost everything in you for example you can turn off and lock down your car if a thief try to steal your car, you can even listen to your car’s cabin voices if you want to or so many more cool stuff.</p>

            <h1>RK</h1>

            <p>This is an app developed for just the staff of a company. They can see available services and choose anyone that they can do.</p>

            <p>It also has a internal messaging system so users can send messages to each other.</p>

            <p><br /></p>

            <h1>XDatabase</h1>

            <p>In this app I put another passion of mine into app development and that is “Magic tricks”. I made some magical code that somehow “I won’t tell ya :D” it can give you the information when you get a picture from your friend’s face.</p>

            <p>All your friends will think that you are a special secret agent and you should never tell them how this app works.</p>

            <p>But I know you will, LOL.</p>

            <h1>Color Wheel</h1>

            <p>I have a huge interest in making games with unity but in this project I wanted to see if I can make a game with just pure swift.</p>

            <p>I have some experience with spriteKit for 2d games and sceneKit for 3d games but in this game I did’nt use them and made everything with default iOS methods.</p>

            <p><br /></p>

            <h1>Numbomb</h1>

            <p>This is another game that I developed with pure swift and in this game numbers will fall from top and before they reach the keypad you should type those numbers.</p>

            <p>Game speed will increase over time and also the numbers will get bigger.</p>

            <p><br /></p>

            <h1>Chooked</h1>

            <p>In this project I just wanted to implement custom flow layout in UICollectionView & all sort of animatios.</p>

            <p>It was inspired by the famous app named “Hooked”.</p>

            <p>for educational purposes only.</p>

            <h2>Tech Talk</h2>
            <p>I can make <strong>beautiful interactive UI & Animations</strong> and I like to give the user a great experience exploring the apps that I’ve built.</p>
            <p>I also prefer making UI Components all by code because I find it more comfortable for me But I can make any sort of UI Using Storyboards too. (I didn’t start to implement <strong>SwiftUI</strong> Yet because there are a large percentage of people who didn’t updated their OS to iOS 13)</p>
            <p>The libraries that I often use are : <strong>Alamofire, Snapkit, Fabric Crashlytics, Google Sign in, Facebook Sign in, Apple Sign in</strong>, etc. I also have some experience with apple built in frameworks such as <strong>SpriteKit, SceneKit, MessageFilterExtensions</strong>.</p>
            <p>I worked with other languages and softwares like <strong>Unity(C#), Unreal Engine, Blender, React JS for making web apps, mongoDB, SQL</strong>, etc. But I’m not expert in any of them.</p>
            <p>I would love to research, learn and implement any any new feature into my applications very vast and convinient.</p>
