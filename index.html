            <p>We invented Tipsy ™ to reduce the number of heavy coins carrying every day. Tipsy ™ is a platform that handles Micro-Payments by credit cards.
            <p> Next time you can tip a waiter with tipsy, directly from your credit card. Street sellers, musicians, performers, and anyone can use Tipsy as a new income channel and let their audience to pay with credit cards.</p>

            <p>The technologies that I have used are: </p>

            <h1 id="pointautomotive">iMoozik</h1>

            <p>This is iMoozik. with this application you can search and download any song on the internet into your iOS Device. You can also make playlists for yourself.</p>

            <p>I made it for educational purposes only.</p>

            <!-- <p>This project aimed to simplify the car buying experience by removing the physical car dealership from the car buying process. Customers express interest in a vehicle and the Sales People make the sale happen.</p>

            <p>Sales people could provide an up-to-the-minute lease price for customers.</p>

            <p align="center">
              <img width="750" src="images/pointSalesPersonScreenShotSmall.png">
            </p>

            <p>This was a large project lasting a year and spanning four separate iOS and Web apps in total. We used API services from MarketScan (an automotive lease data provider)and Fuel (for stock images of all the cars). The app also
              incorporated VIN scanning &amp; decoding for customers to monitor their vehicle health and mileage.</p>

            <p>This app is currently on the iOS App Store:</p>

            <h1 id="thinkgroup">SMS Police</h1>

            <p>This is SMS Police. This app seperates the spam sms messages and put it in different folder on your iOS device official messages app.</p>

            <p>By default applications don’t have access to messages that’s why I used “ Message Filter Extension ” that Apple provided to developers to enable them make some rules that decide if a message is spam or not.</p>

            <p>I used machine learning in this app so the ml model will get better in deciding which message is spam.</p>

            <h1 id="chaldeantraits">Rahyab</h1>



            <p>I developed this app for a startup in iOT field. with this app you can control you car with your mobile.</p>

            <p>You can control almost everything in you for example you can turn off and lock down your car if a thief try to steal your car, you can even listen to your car’s cabin voices if you want to or so many more cool stuff.</p>

            <h1 id="dbcnumber">RK</h1>

            <p>This is an app developed for just the staff of a company. They can see available services and choose anyone that they can do.</p>

            <p>It also has a internal messaging system so users can send messages to each other.</p>

            <p><br /></p>

            <h1 id="highload">XDatabase</h1>

            <p>In this app I put another passion of mine into app development and that is “Magic tricks”. I made some magical code that somehow “I won’t tell ya :D” it can give you the information when you get a picture from your friend’s face.</p>

            <p>All your friends will think that you are a special secret agent and you should never tell them how this app works.</p>

            <p>But I know you will, LOL.</p>

            <h1 id="colorwheel">Color Wheel</h1>

            <p>I have a huge interest in making games with unity but in this project I wanted to see if I can make a game with just pure swift.</p>

            <p>I have some experience with spriteKit for 2d games and sceneKit for 3d games but in this game I did’nt use them and made everything with default iOS methods.</p>

            <h1 id="numbomb">Numbomb</h1>

            <p>This is another game that I developed with pure swift and in this game numbers will fall from top and before they reach the keypad you should type those numbers.</p>

            <p>Game speed will increase over time and also the numbers will get bigger.</p>

            <h1 id="chooked">Chooked</h1>

            <p>In this project I just wanted to implement custom flow layout in UICollectionView & all sort of animatios.</p>

            <p>It was inspired by the famous app named “Hooked”.</p>
